# optimized-processing-conditional-logic-FindPrime

Here is a basic example of optimized conditional logic.

The main.cpp is a complete program with in-depth documentation and simple explanations of how I implemented optimized conditional logic saving substantial computation in essentially two logical expressions condensing a common beginners method for testing prime numbers.


==> Crash course for the curious before taking a closer look at process logic.
Conditional expressions must evaluate as true for logical statements to be
executed within a program. 

The following screenshot is a live code example with detailed explanations in the comments.
